#FLEXBOX

>This small repo explains the importance of using new flexbox css3 features.

###Tired of float, clear, static dimensions?

With a short block of code like this you can manage the html display quickly and safely.

```css
body{
display: flex;
flex-flow: column wrap;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
}
```

Moreover it is compatible with almost all latest version browsers (desktop & mobile).
